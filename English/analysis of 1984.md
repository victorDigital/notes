## Narrator/Point Of View (POV)
Narrator/POV is important in a literary text because it determines through whose eyes the reader experiences the story. Therefore, the type of narrator/POV chosen for a story influences what you as a reader get to know about especially the characters in the story. The two most common types of narrator/POV are first person narrator and third person narrator. The following overview shows the main characteristics of the two types of narrator/POV.

we see the excerpt from a 3. person POV, it primarily focuses on the thoughts of Winston Smith which is the protagonist in [[1984 (excerpt)]]

## Setting
Setting is a description of where and when the story takes place. In a short story there are fewer settings compared to a novel. This is due to the fact that a short story is inherently a shorter story than the one told in a novel.

A setting can be physical:

- Historical time, season, time of the day etc.
- Nation, country, city, in the countryside, ocean, forest, mountains.
- Environment influenced by social class, age group, ethnic group.
- Fantasy or realistic environment.

You have to consider what role the physical setting plays in the story. Is it an important part of the plot or theme? Or is it just a backdrop against which the action takes place?

However, setting is not only a physical description of a place connected to the story. It can also set the mood of the story. Mood is the feeling the story creates in the reader such as happy, sad or scared. It is created by giving the reader images of the setting and creating a certain feeling/mood in the reader. By choosing specific words and by weaving their [connotations](https://theenglishhandbook.systime.dk/index.php?id=167#c413) together, it is possible for the author to give the setting a particular atmosphere. Look at the following two descriptions of a rose.

1984 - predicting the future
midday spring (1 PM)
in the city, in an apartment complex
second class (not upper) - smelly

time is set in military time, could mean less focus on the individual and more on the collective

no privacy - for the greater good - relates to big brother

no working elevators, worn down

no color - lifeless - devoid of life, except for the posters - hollow


## Mood
"The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats"

coarse soap and blunt razor blades

the world looked cold

there seemed to be no colour in anything


## Characterization
haracterization deals with how the characters in the story are described and develop. A main character in a text is called a protagonist. In some cases, the main character can be an antagonist. Short stories have fewer characters than novels and they usually focus on one central character or protagonist. Novels, on the other hand, may have more than one important main character. Characterization is crucial in literary works because the characters move the story forward and make it interesting to read and relate to. When you analyse important characters in a text, it is essential that you look beyond their physical appearance. The way you get to know the true nature of the characters is often through their actions and relations to others. An author can choose to write a direct characterization (_Sally was kind and helpful to other people_) or indirect by showing what the character is like through the character's actions and relations to others (_Sally helped the old woman finding her way home_). Often, the main character(s) will go through a development in a story. Thus, when analyzing a character in a literary text, you should look for the following:

|Characteristics|What to look for|Examples|
|---|---|---|
|External characteristics|- gender<br>- age<br>- appearance<br>- occupation|"...Owen Meany, who was so small that not only did his feet not touch the floor when he sat in his chair - his knees did not extend to the edge of his seat; therefore, his legs stuck out straight, like the legs of a doll."<br><br>John Irving, A Prayer for Owen Meany (1989) William Morrow and Company, Inc.|
|Internal characteristics|What feelings are dominant?<br><br>- anxiety<br>- bitterness<br>- happiness<br>- sorrow<br>- confusion etc.<br><br>Does the character's past affect him/her?<br><br>How does the character behave throughout the text?<br><br>Do his/her actions change throughout the story?|"My conscience, my pity, my hopes disappeared a long time ago (probably at Harvard) if they ever did exist.<br><br>There are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil, all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward it, I have now surpassed. I still, though, hold on to one single bleak truth: no one is safe, nothing is redeemed.<br><br>Yet I am blameless."<br><br>Brett Easton Ellis, American Psycho (1991) Vintage Contemporaries/Random House|
|Personal characteristics|- patient<br>- ill-tempered<br>- shy<br>- emotional<br>- caring<br>- dominant<br>- naive<br>- snobbish<br>- lazy etc.|"I didn't relate well to people my age. Maybe the truth was that I didn't relate well to people, period.<br><br>Even my mother, who I was closer to than anyone else on the planet, was never in harmony with me, never on exactly the same page."<br><br>Stephenie Meyer, Twilight (2005) Little, Brown and Company|
|Social characteristics|- education<br>- job<br>- position in the family<br>- relationship to other people|"But Griff was the best-dressed man present. They all envied him for that.<br><br>And nobody but his wife really knew how poor he was in pocket….<br><br>She never criticized him in public, by gesture or by attitude, and she said very little to him about his ways, in their incensed apartment."<br><br>Austin C. Clarke, Griff, in The Oxford Book of Canadian Short Stories selected by Margaret Atwood & Robert Weaver (1988) Oxford University Press|
|Values important to the main character|- material possessions<br>- freedom<br>- honesty<br>- excitement<br>- challenge<br>- respect<br>- order|"Hughes and McCrae were fastidious men who took pride in their old colonial house, the clean simple lines and stucco walls and the painted pale blue picket fence."<br><br>Barry Callaghan, The Black Queen, in The Oxford Book of Canadian Short Stories selected by Margaret Atwood & Robert Weaver (1988) Oxford University Press|
|Static or dynamic|**Static:**<br><br>A static character remains the same throughout the story. Characters with an already existing charismatic, appealing or heroic persona tend NOT to change.<br><br>**Dynamic:**<br><br>A dynamic character develops through the story and it is what makes the story compelling. Dynamic characters may go through life-changing events, come-of-age, go through difficult trials or develop new qualities for better or worse.|**Static characters:** Sherlock Holmes, James Bond<br><br>**Dynamic character:** Harry Potter|

## Themes
A theme is the underlying topic or the universal idea which the author wants to pass on to the reader through the literary text. Often, the theme is not expressed directly in the text but the reader has to read between the lines to guess the theme through reading and analysing especially setting and characters. A theme can be the moral of the story. It can be about universal ideas, general human conditions such as love, hate and relationships or about conditions concerning specific groups such as immigrants, children or cultures.
