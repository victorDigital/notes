The Principles of Newspeak is an appendix to George Orwell’s novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, which describes the fictional language of Newspeak, the official language of the totalitarian state of Oceania. Newspeak was designed to limit the range of thought and expression, and to make any dissent or opposition to the ruling party impossible. Newspeak had three main features: the reduction of vocabulary, the elimination of synonyms and antonyms, and the creation of compound words that combined two concepts into one. For example, the word good was used to express all positive qualities, and its antonym ungood was used for all negative ones. The word free could only be used in a physical sense, such as “free from lice”, and not in a political or intellectual sense. The word crimethink meant “thoughtcrime”, which was any deviation from the party’s ideology.

The appendix explains that Newspeak was not fully implemented in 1984, but was expected to replace Oldspeak (or Standard English) by 2050. However, the appendix also implies that Newspeak failed to achieve its purpose, and that the party was eventually overthrown. This is suggested by the fact that the appendix is written in Oldspeak, and that it refers to Newspeak in the past tense. [The appendix also mentions that some Oldspeak texts, such as the Declaration of Independence, could not be translated into Newspeak without losing their meaning](https://qz.com/95696/you-probably-didnt-read-the-most-telling-part-of-orwells-1984-the-appendix)[1](https://qz.com/95696/you-probably-didnt-read-the-most-telling-part-of-orwells-1984-the-appendix). This indicates that some ideas and values could not be erased by Newspeak, and that language had a power to resist totalitarianism.
